# rtcmixlib
An on-going collection of user-defined RTcmix functions — most of them for easy handling of lists and soon-to-include machine learning algorithms.

## How to use it
Before any function is called — e.g. at the top of the script —, specify either the relative or absolute path, of the *fthlib*.sco file, **as a non-string** (i.e. without quotation marks) and **after** the `include` keyword. For instance, if *fthlib*.sco is located in the same folder as the script using it, the line should read `include fthlib.sco` or, alternatively, `include ./fthlib.sco`

**Note**: Documentation is included at the top of the main file (i.e. *fthlib*.sco) but it's minimal at the moment. More examples for each function to come.
