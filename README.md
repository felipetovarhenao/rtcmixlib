# rtcmixlib
An on-going collection of user-defined RTcmix functions â€” most of them for easy handling of lists and soon-to-include machine learning algorithms.

## How to use it
Keep the *fthlib*.sco file in the same folder as the script in which it will be used. To call the functions, simply use the 'include' keyword to import the library into the script.

**Note**: Documentation is included at the top of the main file (i.e. fthlib.sco) but it's minimal at the moment. More examples for each function to come.
