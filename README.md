# rtcmixlib
An on-going collection of user-defined RTcmix functions â€” most of them for easy handling of lists and soon-to-include machine learning algorithms.

## How to use it
Make sure the *fthlib*.sco file in the same folder as the script in which it will be used. To call the functions, simply add the line `include fthlib.sco` at the top of the script.

**Note**: Documentation is included at the top of the main file (i.e. fthlib.sco) but it's minimal at the moment. More examples for each function to come.
